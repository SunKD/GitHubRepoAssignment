				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2><br>
					<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremly popular for a varioty of reasons It is a small ad lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host envoronment(a web browser or Node Server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#">Variabl Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript must be indetified with unique names. These unique names are caleed identifier. <span class="blue_letters">var x;</span></li>
						<li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it. giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assignms a value to a variable. <span class="blue_letters">var x = 10;</span></li>
						<li><a href="#">Data Type</a> Data types are an important convept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. Tgese are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="blue_letters">true</span> or <span class="blue_letters">false;</span> null - <span class="blue_letters">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="blue_letters">42 </span>or <span class="blue_letters">tr3.14159;</span>String- <span class="blue_letters">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>Array- <span class="blue_letters">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="blue_letters">{first_name:'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
						<li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting diffent code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. there are the folowwing conditonals statments: <span class="blue_letters">if </span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="blue_letters">else if </span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="blue_letters">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
						<li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
						<li><a href="#">Functions</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. This o fit as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from IKea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
